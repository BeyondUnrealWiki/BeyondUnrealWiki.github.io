<p>Status:</p>
<p>Lead coder in Defence Alliance ( <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/da">http://www.planetunreal.com/da</a> )</p>
<p>And I've written a little tool for html documentation creation ( undox was a bit too buggy <img alt=":/" src="emoticons/hmm.gif" align="middle"> )</p>
<p>( <a href="http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_dwaldh">http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_dwaldh</a> )</p>
<p>I like the output a bit more than that from uncodex. But I guess uncodex's parser engine is superior to mine. Maybe I'll try to make a real parser once, not that I already have enough things to do.</p>
<p>Well that statement is a few months old, I actually wrote a parser. It parses almost everything besides defaultproperties and code.</p>
<h2><a name="0.2"></a>Rant about the Unreal engine</h2>
<p>Although I haven't seen source of Unreal 2 or any other newer Unreal based game besides UT2003, I'm quiet sure that they all share a big portion of code. I'm seeing Unreal running in the wrong direction (codewise).</p>
<ul><li>The weapons... While the idea of havin firemodes doesn't look too bad after all, the implementation is awful. There's a lot of native code calling the different functions on the firemodes. Also, the number of firemodes are limited to 2. I guess only those 2 are handled native. Then again the attachment of the weapon which produces third person effects is also called natives (function broadcast which is a bit complicated in unrealscript). I assert that they were in a great hurry and therefore decided not to introduce new language features but hack it in native.</li>
<li>The GUI... I liked the UT menus much more <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"> But it's not only that, also the defaultproperties "inner class" hack. Real inner classes would've been a nice addition. At least they introduced delegates which, I think, is a inferior concept. Well I might be biased of being java coder and not C# one. In addition to the hacked "inner class" stuff they also made hacked "object instantiation" possible. As I already said my hopes are that they were in a big hurry. </li>
</ul>
<p>UT1 had a much clearer concept for its time. While it's clear to me why the used unrealscript in Unreal 1 a switch to java in UT might have been a good decision. The would've had the decision of using a real java vm or use a bytecode interpreter just like with unrealscript. Of course it'd have been a brutal switch, and a lot of work to generate a new codebase. But...</p>
<p>There are alot of java compilers already out there which do their job very well. Not only compilers, all sorts of tools which makes the programers life easier.</p>
<p>I think that's also reason why there are more quake engine based games and mods out there. Now don't get me wrong, I am still coding in unrealscript but it's just the nature of people like me to complain lol.</p>
<p>There was also some "rectangle extends square" OOP thingy here earlier which might be useful to know when reading the discussion below.</p>
<h2><a name="0.3"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p><em class="em2">EntropicLqd:</em> A lot of the ideas within the Unreal Engine are pretty good but they always seem to break them when they implement them.  My fave example is the Controller-Pawn mess.  It could have been a very nice, clean separation of master and puppet - but noooo they had to duck-tape the master's fingers to the puppet strings, and tie the puppets head to his hand.</p>
<p class="indent1">Delegates in UnrealScript are very cool.  I've not had the chance to play with pointers to functions (a blast from my C past) for a long time so it's nice to have that facility back  It's a shame they didn't make more use of them in the main stream of the code.  I've always been of the opinion that InnerClasses are just plain ugly although I understand the rationale behind them.</p>
<p class="indent1">There are more Quake engine based mods around for two reasons I think.  Firstly, overall the player base is larger - which means there are just more people around to make mods.  Secondly the mods are written in C/C++ and compiled down into DLLs (at least they were last time I made a mod for the quake engine - Quake 2).  Programming in C/C++ is perceived to be way more "cool" than programming in Unreal Script.  Especially as most games companies want people who know C++.</p>

<p><em class="em2">Tarquin:</em> hi there. <img alt=":D" src="emoticons/biggrin.gif" align="middle"> welcome to the Wiki.</p>
<p><em class="em2">ZxAnPhOrIaN:</em> Welcome aboard and welcome to the wiki! <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"> <img alt=":tup:" src="emoticons/tup.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">Dante:</em> Oh guys, you're too fast <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">ZxAnPhOrIaN:</em> I look at the <a href="recent-changes.html">Recent Changes</a>, at average, every 15 minutes! <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">EntropicLqd:</em> There is only one true style of coding your barbarian - it's mine - Mwhahahahah <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"> Once you realise how pointless arguments about coding style really are they can be used to great effect on a Friday afternoon when basking in the afterglow of a lunchtime visit to the pub.  "Why aren't you lot working?" &ndash; "We are, we are discussing some problems with the coding standards". <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">Tarquin:</em> Seeing as a square is a <em class="em1">special case</em> of a rectangle, I'd say that specialization would agree with you, and have rectangle as the parent class of square. (and Quadrilateral as the parent of rectangle <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"> )</p>
<p><em class="em2">Dante:</em> Yeap, but <em class="em1">Specialisation</em> says: A rectangle is a just a square with one side-length differing from the other. It may not make sense in this case, but specialisation rule tells to do so... </p>
<p><em class="em2">EntropicLqd:</em> What rule book on <em class="em1">Specialisation</em> are you reading Dante?  I'd be interested to see the justification that a rectangle is a special type of square rather than the reality, which is that a square is a special type of rectangle.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Dante:</em> Those aren't my rules, and I wouldn't do it, but it's what I learned from "practical computer science". Specialisation means, to add "information" to an sub-class. And storing a square needs less information ( 1 var ) than storing a rectangle. Thus a rectangle is a square with 1 additional side. It's not the way I would do it, but that is the way to go if you follow specialisation-specs. ( Which was what we had to do in exams ... ). I don't mean to say that specialisation is bad, but taking square and rectangle as example is dumb.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Bjorn:</em> What about the "is a" relationship that should exist between an instance of an object and its class and all the superclasses of it? Like a PlayerPawn is a Pawn. Surely, you can say a Square is a Rectangle but not that a Rectangle is a Square.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Mychaeel:</em> In OOP, that's a bit tricky.  In fact, in OOP you'd rather subclass "Rectangle" from "Square" since the concept "rectangle" extends the concept "square" by the ability to have different side lengths...</p>
