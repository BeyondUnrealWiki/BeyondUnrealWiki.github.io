<h2><a name="0.1"></a>Warnings </h2>
<dl><dt>Warning, '<i>name</i>' obscures '<i>name</i>' defined in base class</dt><dd>You declared a class variable, struct or enum with the same name as a class variable, struct or enum of a superclass. This will obscure the object in the superclass so you can't access it in the code of your class anymore.<br>In UT2004 this warning also applies to local function variables which obscure class variables in the same class or one of its superclasses.</dd></dl>
<p><em class="em2">Foxpaw:</em> Could you get around this by simply using Self.? IE, if variable A was obscured by local variable A, you should be able to access local A with A, and global A with Self.A. Seems like it would work.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Wormbo:</em> Of course you could, but the warning is there because the usual way to access the class varaible is blocked. It's easier to find the problem with this warning when you access the obscuring variable instead of the obscured one in you code.</p>
<dl><dt>Warning, '<i>variable name</i>' - unreferenced local variable</dt><dd>A function declares a local variable but doesn't use it beyond that &ndash; you may as well remove it if <span class="interwiki"><img

<h2><a name="0.2"></a>Syntax Errors</h2>
<h3><a name="0.2.1"></a>General Structure</h3>
<dl><dt>Bad class definition '<i>class name</i>'</dt><dd>In <a href="unreal-tournament-2003.html">UT2003</a>, the most common cause for this error is that you accidentally used "expands" instead of "extends."  The old keyword "expands" is not supported anymore.  (It has been considered deprecated for a long while already.)</dd><dt>Superclass <i>class name</i> of class <i>other class name</i> not found</dt><dd>The superclass of one of your classes couldn't be found. Check the class header of the second class for typos. If the superclass is in the same package also check its class header, if not check the <a href="game-ini-file.html">Game Ini File</a>'s EditPackages lines for missing packages. </dd><dt>Unexpected end of file at end of class</dt><dd>This is usually caused by one or more missing "<code>}</code>". This error can be quite annoying in large classes. Most of it is prevented by proper code indentation and (what experienced coders frequently do) writing <em class="em1">both</em> the opening and the closing brace at the same time and then filling in code between them.</dd><dt>Unexpected 'defaultproperties'</dt><dd>The <a href="default-properties.html">default properties</a> block can only be used outside of <a href="unrealed-3.html">UnrealEd</a>. Within UnrealEd, they have to be set from the <a href="actor-class-browser.html">Actor Classes Browser</a> interface; hidden variables (not declared to show up in any of the property groups) can have their defaults set via the <a href="unrealed-console.html">UnrealEd console</a>. Use <a href="compiling-with-ucc.html">UCC Make</a> instead of UnrealEd to compile your classes if you want to use this feature. This error can also happen when you use a weird commenting style like:<pre class="uscript"><span class="uscript-comment">/* some comment
*/</span><span class="uscript-comment">//===========</span></pre>Basically using a multi-line comment immediately followed by a single-line comment anywhere in your class breaks the parser and makes it complain about the defaultproperties keyword. Add a whitespace or linebreak or think about your commenting style in general. <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"></dd><dt>Unexpected '<i>} or identifier</i>'</dt><dd>This is caused by one or more missing "<code>{</code>" or too many "<code>}</code>". See suggestions above.</dd><dt>Call to '<i>function</i>': Type mismatch in parameter <i>number</i></dt><dd>One of the parameters in your function call doesn't have the right type and can't be automatically <a href="typecasting.html">casted</a> to it.  Look up the original declaration of the function (in the original UnrealScript source code or here on the Wiki) and double-check against the types of the values you're actually using.</dd><dt>Error, Call to 'Function/Something'</dt><dd>bad or missing parameter 1:Due to Non-Existing Variable or Spelling mistake Example:<pre class="uscript">TriggerEvent<span class="uscript-operator">(</span><span class="uscript-name">'SomethingWrongHere'</span><span class="uscript-operator">,</span> <span class="uscript-keyword">Self</span><span class="uscript-operator">,</span> Instigator<span class="uscript-operator">)</span></pre></dd><dt>Internal fixup error 0</dt><dd>This error occurs when using <code>break</code> in an <code>if</code> statement inside a <code>case</code> block.</dd><dt>'Else': Bad command or expression</dt><dd>Make sure there is an <code>If</code> right before the mentioned <code>else</code>.

See <a href="flow-syntax.html">Flow Syntax</a>.</dd><dt>Error, Bad or missing expression in '(some expression)'</dt><dd>Check whatever comes after the expression mentioned in the message. For example, a "Bad or missing expression in 'If'" could mean the condition does not evaluate to a boolean value (True or False), and generally you might have mistyped the function or variable name.</dd><dt>Error,Right type is incompatable with "$"</dt><dd>Usually when you have only specified the name of an array and not the variable contained inside.</dd><dt>Error,Missing '(' in 'if'</dt><dd>Usually due to wrong operator eg. using If(a=b) instead of if(a==B).</dd><dt>Error,Missing '(' in 'struct'</dt><dd>Can be caused by leaving Blank spaces in a variable name inside a struct.</dd><dt>'Else If' is not allowed here<br>'Else' is not allowed here</dt><dd>Most likely you have the wrong number of braces after an <code>If</code> statement.</dd><dt>'class' is not allowed here</dt><dd>Generally caused by having your class statement in the wrong place.

Simply put, the compiler simply ceases compiling, generally as soon as opening your package or while it is "Analysing..." I'm not certain what causes this, generally I remove classes from the package until eventually it stops doing it, then see which classes it hangs with and which it does not to help isolate the problem. I've found that sometimes I'll accidentally make my classes extend themselves or extend their own subclasses (a result of not paying attention) and this will cause this type of problem.

<dl><dt>Variable is too large (xxx bytes, 255 max)</dt><dd>These occur when you try to access a data structure that is greater then 255 bytes from another object.You might only be trying to access a little bool but if that bool is part of an array of structs whose total size is bigger than 255 bytes then you're not going to be able to code stuff like:</dd></dl>
<p>bMyvar = otheractor.bigarray[i].bTheirVar ;</p>
<p>Without the compiler choking and giving that "context: variable is too large" error.</p>
<p>To work round this you can code a method into the object that contains the large structure that returns the element you're after (or, if the object is part of a package you can't recompile, then make a subclass and impliment the method there) like this:</p>

With dynamic arrays only a pointer it passed, while with static arrays and structs the whole array/struct will be passed. Yes dynamic arrays are slower, but with a big array it doesn't matter much.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em class="em2">Mychaeel:</em> "Dynamic arrays are slower"?  Only if you count adding and removing elements, but that's plain impossible with static arrays.  Accessing existing array elements is just as fast as with static arrays.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em class="em2">JoeDark:</em> Accessing existing array elements in a dynamic array is only as fast as a static array if they are handled like Vectors in Java where it is actually a static array disguised as a dynamic array. If it's done as a linked list then access is O(n) compared to the static array's O(1) access time so static access is obviously faster, though unless your dealing with a large n not that much faster.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em class="em2">Foxpaw:</em> Well, there's more than just two possible implementations of the dynamic arrays. The Unreal engine is chock full of caching schemes, tables, and other methods of storing and retrieving data that are far more complex than what one would generally assume of the implementation, and render speculation about the number of operations required for a given operation shaky at best. I wouldn't be surprised if static arrays and dynamic arrays are both stored in a relational database and looked up that way. The only way to really tell which is faster is to time them, but even that wouldn't really be accurate, because there's other stuff to consider.</p>
<p class="indent1">For instance, if the implementation is as you suggested, (block of memory for array, linked list for dynamic arrays) then you would be doing a great number of operations on the stack. Anyways, I don't know how dynamic arrays or even static arrays are implemented in the Unreal Engine, but I'd question the notion that dynamic arrays are a linked list - because when you pass one to a function you get a duplicate array, not a pointer into an array.</p>
<p class="indent1"><em class="em2">JoeDark:</em> Fair enough, esp. because uscript is an interpreted language arrays might be implemented any number of ways, including relational databases <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p class="indent1"><em class="em2">Red:</em> I presume the issue is because of how the array is stored in memory. and because dynamic ones only pass a pointer rather than the whole array.still getting the infor be accessing with a method is one workable soultion, but i'm not sure if it would be faster than passing a pointer to a dynamic array.... both methods essentially allow you access the pieces of info you want, in sligthly different ways.</p>

<p><em class="em2">Foxpaw:</em> I don't have UT2003 but I have found something that I think may be the problem. It doesn't surprise me that neither FILE=WHSkins.utx nor FILE=..\textures\WHSkins.utx finds the headlight. The former will look in the base directory of your class, the "Halo" directory, and the second goes up a step then looks in the base directory of your UT2003 install to find a package called "textures." Remember it starts from "Halo," not "Halo\classes." ".." means up one directory. What you need to put to reference "Halo\textures" is "FILE=.\textures\WHSkins.utx." Scratch the last dot, that's just for correct punctuation. ".." means go up one directory, "." means look in this directory. It's basically the same as writing "FILE=\textures\WHSkins.utx" except that the compiler won't accept that, so the single dot is used to denote a subdirectory of the one it starts in.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Languard:</em> Minor correction: UT2003 does accept "FILE=\textures\ect" I don't think having the current directory dot will hurt, but it isn't needed.  Not on XP at least, it might be different for the other OS's.  As a side note, I'm not sure why they      the object files with exec statments, since it is not needed.  I know this because for my sword attachment class, I use an animated mesh that I've placed in the Animations directory, but I do not have any exec statments to      it, and it works fine.  The only thing I can think of is maybe it is for performance reasons.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Languard:</em> Correction to previous satement, you do need the      statments.  My misconception was due to some really bad coding on my part, and I forgot about this one      statement I had in a wierd spot.  Yet another reason why you should always code neatly, even if it is throwaway code.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Foxpaw:</em> Yes, I don't think you need the dots, the problem with the code that was listed was that it had a double dot and was going up one directory isntead of going fromt he current directory. You actually don't need the      statements if you have the thing you were going to      already in another package, so long as you refer to that package at compile-time. I never use      statements and it works fine for me.</p>

I already sorted out the dependencies so DataObject compiles before ActingClass. I also tried scrapping the static array in the data object (using dynamic arrays only) but that didn't fix it. Anyone encountered this before? Does anyone care to duplicate the results?</p>
<p><em class="em2">Wormbo:</em> Your mistake is that you try to copy a static array. While they can be passed as function parameters, they cannot be assigned to a different array variable directly. (Add this to the main body of the page, please.)</p>
<p><em class="em2">Juxtapose:</em> That seems to have nuked it. I erased my last comment because I was doing something else wrong. I refactored my classes and forgot to update my .bat file to delete the old .u file. Thanks.</p>
