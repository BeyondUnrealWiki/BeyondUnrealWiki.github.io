	<div class="wiki"><p>A new mapper who hasn't publically released anything for fear of not putting out something of quality...The current map I am working on has an overdone theme (egypt, but all of the egypt maps suck so hopefully mine will be better) and is very boxy, so I'm just learning as much as I can before I release anything...maybe something of quality will come of it. Peace Out</p>
<p><em class="em2">Tarquin:</em> Hi there. welcome to the unreal wiki.</p>
<p><em class="em2">EntropicLqd:</em>  Welcome to the Unreal Wiki.  Good luck with the maps &ndash; they'll not be as bad as mine <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">ZxAnPhOrIaN:</em> Hi, welcome to the wiki! <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"> <img alt=":tup:" src="emoticons/tup.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">OMGTTFS:</em> So now that ut2003 has the demo out, should I just scrap my map for UT or should I just go ahead, keep working on it, and release it when I'm done? will anyone still play it?  I'm afriad I'm just wasting my time finishing it and should just wait for the full version of UT2003 to come out and start a new one.  Give me your thoughts.  </p>
<p><em class="em2">Tarquin:</em> Well, you may be able to transfer your map into 2003, but the mapping technique is so different (<a href="static-mesh.html">Static Mesh</a>es etc). I expect BSP-based maps are still possible, but they will be bound to the same polycount limits as UT, or similar. The new engine doesn't push this, rather, they have devised smarted workarounds and made better use of hardware. (still, it would be interesting to see what sort of polycount is possible using BSP brushes in UT2003). So you can either drop it now, or go "retro" with it, or totally rework it which really amound to starting the same map idea from scratch. I would say move on, unless your ideas were really really spiffing. I think most mappers have early maps which they never released. I have about 6 or so, which I stopped work on because I realised they were lousy. Some of the ideas have been recycled since. It's just cchance that makes your early mapping period coincide with the end of UT mapping. YOu can take this in one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>The "Tarquin": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! This is SO NOT GOOD" kick things, rant and rave a lot, declare you willl never map again, calm down, start mapping for UT2003 a week later</li>
<li>The "Mychaeel": "any work we learn from is never wasted". Consider the world in zen-like calm serenity. start mapping for UT2003.</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="em2">Dante:</em> lol</p>
<p><em class="em2">OMGTTFS:</em> Well I kind of went against you guys and decided to release it anyways.  I just didn't want all that time and effort I had put into it go to waste, so I gave it to Nalicity last night.  So whenever they decide to post it I guess it'll be available.  I learned everything I know from the wiki so if you're interested you can check it out and see what a completely green mapper can do using the wiki.  I was impressed.  DM-Rath_of_Ra if anyone's interested, and yes, I know that's not how you spell "wrath", I did it on purpose...or at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  Peace out</p>
<p><em class="em2">OMGTTFS:</em> Update: I got sick of waiting for NaliCity to post it so I just put it on my clan's web site. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/clone/drakin">[{FAF}]</a>If anyone's interested it's there and I'm soon to start a new (better) map using the new unreal editor. Peace out Vatos</p>
<p><em class="em2">OMGTTFS:</em> Ok, for anyone that might stumble upon this and read it: Where are the best tutorials on Maya PLE?  The Maya web site or the Wiki?  I need to figure out how to use the damn thing in order to make the static meshes I need for the new map but seeing as I opened up the thing and only saw things I was remotly familiar with, I don't know what the hell I'm doing and am in need of some help.  Thanks</p>
<p><em class="em2">Mychaeel:</em> Probably the Maya website since I haven't seen a lot of Maya tutorials here yet.  (But it'd certainly be nice to have some.)</p>
<p><em class="em2">OMGTTFS:</em> Once again for anyone who might stumble across this and know the answer: How would you make a custom shape in maya to act as a volume in the editor? If I have the shape I want in maya can I import it and then somehow convert that into a volume or should I just manipulate individual volumes in the editor to the desired shape? Thanks</p>
<p><em class="em2">EntropicLqd:</em> Although I'm going to fail to answer your question, as a general rule try and keep your volume shapes as simple as possible.  The only way I know how to make volumes is using the red builder brush.</p>
