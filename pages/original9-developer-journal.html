	<div class="wiki"><h2><a name="0.1"></a>Whee, Updatorz! <img alt=":D" src="emoticons/biggrin.gif" align="middle"></h2>
<p><em class="em3">5/02/03:</em> It's been awhile since I last updated this page so...update. <img alt=":P" src="emoticons/tongue.gif" align="middle"> I'm still having that problem with my map (Look down a little). I'm still looking forward to someone suggesting something <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle">. Well, RO's been progressing a lot over the last week. There's not much I can really say though. Though, I think our new update will be worth the wait. On another note: I'm going to WW2 reenactment Saturday. I plan on meeting one of our fans there. I plan on taking plenty of pictures of the german stuff. (German vs. Brittish and the Brittish have to win <img alt=":P" src="emoticons/tongue.gif" align="middle">). I hope I get to fire a kar while I'm there, too!</p>
<p>Anyway, peace out! <img alt=":D" src="emoticons/biggrin.gif" align="middle"></p>
<h2><a name="0.2"></a>I can see the finish line but I can't reach it.</h2>
<p><em class="em3">4/19/03:</em> Well, I found out it's not the textures missing that's the probably. I'm not really sure what the problem is. I load up UT2k3 and try to play the map UT2k3 just freezes. As Seanboy said to me: "I'm baffeled". Seems everybody that I've talked to about my map seems clueless. It's like the UT god hates me so he cursed my map. If anyone does have any suggestions <em class="em2">PLEASE</em> add a comment.</p>
<p>BTW, Chocolate Mochas own. <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"></p>
<h2><a name="0.3"></a>Just one of those days. <img alt="=/" src="emoticons/hmm.gif" align="middle"></h2>
<p><em class="em3">4/18/03:</em>  Have you ever had one of those days when it seemed that nothing worked and the world was out to get you (Well, maybe not the world)? Today I found out when some texture packages got cleaned up my map receives an error. It turns some surfaces NULL. No biggy, right? Wrong. After fixing those brushes I find that have the NULL references I see that the next time I load map I find that the map tries to look for those textures again. I've tried almost everything. I've even tried to export the map to a .t3d and open it with notepad to try the texture references but I seem to have <em class="em2">zerp</em> luck. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions feel free to add them as a comment. <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"> </p>
<h2><a name="0.4"></a>Finding...</h2>
<p><em class="em3">4/17/03:</em> I just discovered these developer journals recently. I always wanted something like this or a .plan. <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=151469&highlight=DMUnheard">[DM-Unheard and DM-TheAmbivalent]</a> are two of my maps that I have released. These two are my only released maps because I am a picky person when it comes to release maps. <img alt=":P" src="emoticons/tongue.gif" align="middle"> I'll probably use this page has place to show off some of my Red Orchestra maps to the public. </p>
<hr class="thin"><p>I guess I'll talk a little about <a href="http://www.redorchestramod.com">[Red Orchestra]</a> since I joined. I first joined Januray 9th of 2003. At first I thought I was going to have to wait a week for responce for when I applied for a job as a mapper. I got home from school and checked my e-mail to find Jeremy had already e-mailed me and said to join their IRC channel (#redorchestra @ irc.gamesnet.com). I came onto their IRC channel to Jeremy pretty much said I was hired. I was impressed at the communication the mod had. Though, nowdays the team may take longer to decide if someone can join due to the recent Board of Directors system. A little while after I joined RO I heard that Ramm-Jaeger and Seanboy where going to join us after TTR's released 1.1 of their mod. Ramm lately has proven himself very valuable to us and the mod. Our progress and increased greatly buy his coding skills and coding has been working much more smoothly. Seanboy has also proven himself worthy with his beautiful map 'Murmansk'. About a week or so after Ramm and Sean joined us Masako, our current texture artist, showed up in our IRC channel and started to show off some of his work. It turns out he worked for DoD (Day of Defeat). We pretty much hired him on-the-spot. His textures are some of the best, if I do say so myself <img alt=":P" src="emoticons/tongue.gif" align="middle">. Our most recent joiners are Bittersight (which he switched over from Terrorism:Fight for Freedom) and Warbeast. Both are mappers and Warbeast has received an Ownage award from CliffyB <a href="http://planetunreal.com/cliffyb/ut2003/index2.shtml">[Frozen]</a>. Ripa quit the team about a month ago because school got in the way. Just yesterday he modelled the MG42 to prove he wasn't busy anymore and boy, it sure does kick some ass <img alt=";)" src="emoticons/wink.gif" align="middle"> (Like the rest of his models). Ripa's PPSH'41 model just got a skin (By Geno) and is in-game. You can see the gun here:</p>

<hr class="thin"><p>I will also most likely use this page for anything I <em class="em1">CAN</em> talk about. I will also probably give mapping notes here, aswell. (Look for :NOTE: next to the text)</p>
