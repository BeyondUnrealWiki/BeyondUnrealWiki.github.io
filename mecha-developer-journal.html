<p>Woo-lah.</p>
<p>Noticed PHYS_Hovering on the <a href="physicstype.html">PhysicsType</a> page, and tried playing around with it. I thought it'd be perfect to make skates with, with the part about "making crazy jumps". </p>
<p>Turns out, weird things happen. I threw together a mutator(basing it off of BootsOfJumping) that basically tries to set you in PHYS_Hovering all the time. I've yet to get the hang of state changes&ndash;translocating, firing a remote-Redeemer, or entering/leaving a vehicle resets you to PHYS_Walking. However, I threw in some random lines of code, and now it will reactivate when switching weapons(!?), or getting shot into the air by a bot.</p>
<p>As the page says, PHYS_Hovering apparently wasn't meant to be dealt with. showdebug doesn't list it when it's active, and the pawn frequently gets stuck in animations&ndash;pain(after I used the shieldgun to bunny hop out of some places; hovering renders you unable to get some pickups, or negotiate steep stairs), or weapon switching. Hovering also negates some of the effect of jumppads; running into them on Face3 makes them about a fourth as effective as normal. Hovering also means you don't take any falling damage at all though(you do a neat little bounce effect). You also pretty much ignore walls that aren't 90-degrees vertical&ndash;you can even climb the pyramid in Face3! Seems gentle terrain bumps(like in Antalus) result in the fastest speeds/highest jumps.</p>
<p>I also stuck in foot trails from the Speed Combo for grins; these dissappear about a minute into the level. I've no idea why, again(outside of the usual crappy-code answer).</p>
<p>Bots don't seem to be affected&ndash;although they categorically don't do well with subtle gameplay changes.</p>
<p>And of course, apparently I'm not cleaning up properly&ndash;dying causes an infinite recursion fault.</p>
<p>Still though, it's fun to see the pawn hovering around&ndash;probably could use the effect for an antigrav belt or poor-man's jetpack. I wonder if it was originally intended for the hover bikes, before <a href="karma.html">Karma</a> was added? Will probably keep experimenting with it. And I've now been introduced to just how much an Inventory item can do.</p>
<p>Am still working behind-the-scenes, have a ninja-themed mutator pack planned. Waiting for Lightwave Discovery Edition, to actually get custom meshes in-game.</p>
<h3><a name="0.0.2"></a>02/14/2003</h3>
<p>'s been over a month already?</p>
<p>After a (self-destructed) video project at the top, a two week-long headache in the middle, and some sleepless nights(causing the headache) finishing a design document for Gearframe at the end, it's been hectic. Couple that with my grandmother's decline and passing away, and you could say that "stuff's happened".</p>
<p>But a bit of nose-tweaking on the BU forums have woken me up, so it's off to the races again. The design document should go public(it's being passed around a circle of friends and contacts) within a few days for people to laugh at. In the meantime, I'm trying to clean up some minor Wiki bits I noticed and add some things that have sat around on my drive for awhile.</p>
<h3><a name="0.0.3"></a>01/06/2003</h3>
<p>Seems that Maya PLE won't import anything worth a damn, not even DXF. I'd hoped to import an old <a href="http://voot411.virtualon.net/ajim.htm">[Ajim]</a> model for excretions and laughter, but no dice. And the 4.5 PLE, which gets rid of the watermark, doesn't appear to have an Unreal plugin yet. After a day of indigestion at work followed by a sensible spicy Indian dinner, I'm going to bed.</p>
<h3><a name="0.0.4"></a>01/05/2003</h3>
<p>After moving into a new apartment, waiting for DSL, and enduring the holidays, I've finally gotten to start UT2k3 development. Decided to add a page on the Wiki, and will try to clear up bits about Maya and animation as well. Speaking of which, I'm disappointed in Alias|Wavefront. Not only is their "customized" PLE just the standard PLE(super-annoying watermarks and all&ndash;they could have really stolen gmax's thunder here) with a UT2k3 startup screen, Maya 4.0 is significantly less impressive than I thought it would be. A|W promised "an entirely updated interface!", yet it's still pretty much as it was in 3.0&ndash;a heap of random options just tossed in a pile. Max may not be as powerful but(with the exception of the transform stack) is much more fun to model in than Maya. I think I need to petition the Blender gang to open up bone data in the Python module, now that they've gone open-source. I'd rather spend time working out problems in a familiar interface, rather than work out the interface to solve the problems. Of course, if it was up to me, I'd be using Softimage|XSI, but SI doesn't think the hobbyist's market is for them yet, a pity.</p>
