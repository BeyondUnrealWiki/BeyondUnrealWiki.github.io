<p>Why? There are good reasons for preventing colors while still alowing bold and underline. For example making text stand out without getting spammed by all those weird-colored auto-away messages. </p>

<p><em class="em2">Foxpaw:</em> Hmm, I've never heard of this "fast weapon switching." But 30 ping! I have a cable modem and my ping to localhost is almost 100.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Wormbo:</em> It's a bug exploit where you throw your weapon while running forwards to skip the putdown animation when switching weapons. You immediately pick up the weapon again and since players using this have turned off auto-switching they switch weapons a lot faster than normal. This works better in UT than in UT2003 since weaponswitching is already quite fast in UT2003. The mutator I coded simply prevents picking up an item that moves away from the player.</p>

<hr class="thin"><h2><a name="0.5"></a>The Joys Of Feedback</h2>
<p><em class="em1">(or lack thereof)</em></p>
<p>You probably know how this works: You release a beta version of your mod, map or some other kind or custom content for a game and ask people to give you some feedback. You can be lucky and "only" receive useless "wow this rocks" or "bah this sucks" responses or you can be even more lucky and really receive useful feedback, but usually it's either silence or useless responses.</p>
<p>"Ok", you think, "maybe it's not that bad after all, I'll just release it." &ndash; Be prepared for the flames and whinings, because now the real "feedback" will get back to you.</p>
<ul><li>"Gah, this piece of crap lags terribly!"</li>
<li>"This thing makes my server crash every time now!"</li>
<li>"Hey, it kicks everyone off my server! HEEEELLLPPPPPP!!!!!!!1111one"</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't make your stuff completely idiot-proof, there'll always be an even greater idiot than you expected. Usually it's just a misconfiguration of their server, in the best case they just have a typo in the neccessary ServerPackages line. The worst case-scenario however, is the ignorant server admin newbie who doesn't really know how to configure a server and who doesn't even know about the log file which contains very useful information about any kind of problems occuring while the server is up. This includes important script warnings of the mods running and large amounts of standard <a href="log-warnings.html">log warnings</a> causing the server to lag.</p>
<p>This was reason enough for me to let Anti TCC take care of all the neccessary configuration work if the server admin forgets it. Its default configuration has all checks enabled and it even makes sure its ServerPackages entry is there. Now let's hope I find some more people for beta-testing it...</p>
<h3><a name="0.5.1"></a>Comments</h3>
<p><em class="em2">RegularX:</em> I hear ya.  I've learned to scope out the very few people I know will give honest, complete feedback and hound them when I beta stuff.  Nobody in the Unreal scene really seems to want to help test things, or new ideas, but they sure like to complain when you *do* release it about any problems or shortcomings.  My favorite responses include "where are teh custom models" and "this will be great whenever you're done".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the small size of people willing to test things - you really have to take things with a grain of salt and use your own judgement. By about the second round of testing, at least one person had felt that each of the three teams in Riftwar was "handicapped" or "too weak" compared to the others.   </p>

<hr class="thin"><h2><a name="0.7"></a>UT 2003 Code - Old Ideas, New Stuff And Missing Features</h2>
<p>You thought it couldn't get worse, but then you get to see the UT 2003 UnrealScript source code. You want a proof? Here you are:</p>
<p>The HUD mutators are dead, same with the message mutators. Damage mutators are still kind of alive, but seriously injured. The GameRules's NetDamage (why <em class="em2">Net</em>Damage?) function only allows to change the amount of damage, the HitLocation and Momentum can't be changed anymore. <img alt=":/" src="emoticons/hmm.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p>The UDamage itself doesn't really exist as an object anymore, instead it's spread across several classes like UDamageCharger (the pickup base), UDamagePack (the actual pickup) and UDamageTimer (an Info subclass that stops the UDamage effect after some time). Wait... no Inventory class? Nope, the UDamage's real magic now resides in the xPawn class. All features (the special weapon texture, the firing sound and even the doubled damage) are hardcoded in either Pawn or xPawn. My opinion about that is best expressed with a quote from the Pawn class's TakeDamage code:</p>
<pre class="uscript">    <span class="uscript-keyword">if</span> <span class="uscript-operator">(</span> <span class="uscript-operator">(</span>InstigatedBy <span class="uscript-operator">!=</span> <span class="uscript-keyword">None</span><span class="uscript-operator">)</span> <span class="uscript-operator">&amp;&amp;</span> InstigatedBy<span class="uscript-operator">.</span>HasUDamage<span class="uscript-operator">(</span><span class="uscript-operator">)</span> <span class="uscript-operator">)</span> <span class="uscript-comment">// FIXME THIS SUCKS</span>
        Damage <span class="uscript-operator">*=</span> <span class="uscript-number">2</span><span class="uscript-operator">;</span></pre><p>Ok, so the UDamage code sucks, but what's up with the other thing that powers up the damage someone does &mdash; the berserk combo? Well, it's also hardcoded, but in the Weapon and WeaponFire classes. No Pawn or xPawn code involved. You should think they'd create those two effects by using a common method to change the weapon's damage, but obviously you can't have everything... <img alt="o_O" src="emoticons/ohoh.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p>But maybe you can &ndash; if you do it yourself. There's a DamageAtten property in the WeaponFire class which is used as a damage multiplier for hit-scan and projectile weapons. It's set to 1.0 and doesn't seem to get changed, but the damage is always multiplied by it.</p>
<p>The UDamage now being completely handled by pawn code caused another feature to be removed: No more weapon affectors. In UT the TournamentWeapon class's Affector property could point to a TournamentPickup which got a FireEffect call every time the weapon was fired. That's how the UDamage and Relic of Strength knew when to play their additional firing sounds. With my EnhancedItems package it was even possible to create a whole list of affectors for a weapon, at least as long as only PickupPlus items tried to add themselves to that list. With an EnhancedWeapon as affected weapon the PickupPlus affectors even had the opportunity to draw an effect during the weapon's RenderOverlays. I used this in Rockets UT to draw the UDamage, shield belt, rapid fire and cloak effects and they look pretty good. <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"> In  UT 2003 it's now possible to use an overlay material for any kind of actor. That's how the cool UDamage effect in is done there.</p>
<p>Another good thing in UT 2003 are the damage types. Yes, that old idea from Unreal was picked up again, this time it even worked. :o But guess what: That's another feature I hacked into UT for the use with Rockets UT and other mods.</p>
<p>WildcardBase &ndash; it randomly spawns one of up to eight TournamentPickup classes. <a href="enhanceditems.html">MultiPickupPlus</a> anyone? The MPP for UT was way more powerful. It allowed up to 20 Inventory classes which are not limited to powerups, also weapons, ammo and armor items could be spawned. Another advantage of the MPP was its ability to select items from the list based on a RejectChance, i.e. spawning certain items was more likely than spawning others.</p>

<hr class="thin"><p><em class="em2">Githianki:</em> Do you think these issues are a result of design sloppiness or somehow tied to anticheating measures? Just curious. Is it truly haphazard or is there some logic there?  Knowing the path this game took to completion (suddenly developed, first for one platform then another, etc.) I would hazard the former.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Wormbo:</em> I have no idea. Like I stated above, this page is just a place for me to complain about stuff. <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"></p>
<p><em class="em2">MadNad:</em> Funny, cuz I could swear firerates were faster, but I never saw anything but the damage being multiplied by bezerk.  I wish I could see how this is done.  I tried having a configurable max hold time for a rocket launcher, but the firerates by the client would not use the value by the servers configurable variable, but would use whatever they were configured to.  So the fire anims were out of sync.  The actual rates worked just fine, just not the animation.  I would love to hear any thoughts you have on making this happen, but with the firerates role set to none, I kinda gave up on it.</p>
<p><em class="em2">Bob_The_Beheader:</em> Hmmm...in the middle of a firefight, it is a wee bit difficult to tell if the damage has been increased by 33%. Not as hard as it would be if this were Counter-strike, but still, 33% won't look nearly the same as UDamage's 2x boost.</p>
<hr class="thin"><h2><a name="0.8"></a>Crappy Hacks</h2>
<p>Sometimes game developers have the bad habit of creating hacks to make features compatible to previous versions of a game or mod. Usually these hacks tend to show ugly side-effects later.</p>
<p>The most popular and most annoying example are the Relic mutators in UT Bonuspack 1. The <a href="mutator.html">Mutator</a> class in UT v400 didn't have the NextHUDMutator property, so the developers decided to create the <a href="hudmutator.html">HUDMutator</a> class instead of telling the people that the Relics need a newer version of UT. Now the NextHUDMutator property has been added to the Mutator class, but the HUDMutators don't use it. This is everything else but compatibility. Recently I wrote a <a href="relics-patch.html">Relics Patch</a> which subclasses the RelicHUDMutator to stop it from breaking the HUD mutator list &ndash; works great, but unfortunately it doesn't stop people from doing bad things:</p>
<p>Chaos UT &ndash; a great mod. It was good enough to be bundled with UT's Game Of The Year Edition. Chaotic Dreams found a way to make their mod compatible with the Relic mutators: They created two versions if their HUD mutator, one subclassed from Mutator using the NextHUDMutator property and one subclassed from RelicHUDMutator which uses the HUDMutator's NextRHUDMutator property. The user can switch between the two mutators by enabling or disabling a checkbox in the mod's config window. Unfortunately, none of the original coders still works on the mod and so the new coders had to dig through the code trying to understand, what it does and why it was coded that way. They didn't see why the relic-incompatible HUD mutator had to be in there and simply removed the "Using Relics" option. Everything worked fine for them, there aren't so many HUD mutators out there. I talked to the Chaos UT team about the HUD mutator thing and <a href="jb.html">Jb</a> promised to re-enable that option. I also told him about the Relic HUD Patch I wrote and it will be in the next Chaos UT version. (Hey! <img alt=":)" src="emoticons/smile.gif" align="middle"> ) But now Chaos UT might have to face a new problem:</p>
<p>Not long ago a new mod team released a "Bonus Pack" for UT. The "technoloG Bonus Pack" is a simple collection of mutators and menu enhancements from a team which "represents professional-quality work coupled with innovations and enhancements to the gameplay experience." (quoted from the technoloG website)</p>
<p>I have to admit the new Relics and the SpellUNREAL mutator are fun, but both use the <a href="hudmutator.html">HUDMutator</a> class. The new relics use the original relic's HUD mutator, so it <em class="em1">might</em> be possible that the <a href="relics-patch.html">Relics Patch</a> is able to make the new relics compatible to other HUD mutators, but the SpellUNREAL mutator uses its own subclass of HUDMutator &ndash; the patch won't be able to fix that.</p>
<p>Maybe technoloG should concider updating their bonus pack. The UMOD installer doesn't work with the GOTY edition of UT because it requires Bonuspack 1 to be installed. UT GOTYE includes BP1, the Inoxx Map Pack and the Digital Extremes Pack &ndash; no need to reinstall them or mess around with Manifest.ini just for installing the technoloG bonus pack. Maybe they would also be willing to include the Relic HUD Patch, make their new relics use the patched relic HUD and get that <a href="hudmutator.html">HUDMutator</a> out of SpellUNREAL. Maybe.</p>
